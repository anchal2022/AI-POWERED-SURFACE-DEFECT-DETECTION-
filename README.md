# AI-POWERED-SURFACE-DEFECT-DETECTION-# ðŸ§  AI-Powered Surface Defect Detection using Computer Vision

This project is a smart defect detection system for manufacturing industries using AI and Computer Vision. It aims to automatically identify surface defects in products like metal castings, saving time, reducing errors, and improving quality assurance.



##  Key Features
- Automated defect detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Image preprocessing using OpenCV
- High accuracy on industrial image datasets
- Scalable for different types of surface defects (cracks, scratches, dents, etc.)



##  Tech Stack / Tools Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** â€“ Image processing
- **TensorFlow / Keras** â€“ Model building and training
- **NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas** â€“ Data handling and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** â€“ Development
- **GitHub** â€“ Code versioning and collaboration



##  Folder Details
- `model/` â€“ Contains trained model or training scripts
- `dataset/` â€“ Folder for sample defect images (you can add a link if dataset is large)
- `src/` â€“ Includes preprocessing, training, and prediction scripts
- `images/` â€“ Contains sample output, architecture flowcharts, etc.
- `requirements.txt` â€“ List of required Python packages
